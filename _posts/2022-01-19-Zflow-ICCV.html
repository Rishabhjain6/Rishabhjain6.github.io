<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Image-based virtual try-on ok involves synthesising perceptually
    convincing images of a model wearing a particular
    garment and has garnered significant research interest due
    to its immense practical applicability. Recent methods involve
    a two stage process: i) warping of the garment to
    align with the model ii) texture fusion of the warped garment
    and target model to generate the try-on output. Issues
    arise due to the non-rigid nature of garments and the
    lack of geometric information about the model or the garment.
    It often results in improper rendering of granular details.
    We propose ZFlow, an end-to-end framework, which
    seeks to alleviate these concerns regarding geometric and
    textural integrity (such as pose, depth-ordering, skin and
    neckline reproduction) through a combination of gated aggregation
    of hierarchical flow estimates termed Gated Appearance
    Flow, and dense structural priors at various stage
    of the network. ZFlow achieves state-of-the-art results as
    observed qualitatively, and on quantitative benchmarks of
    image quality (PSNR, SSIM, and FID). The paper presents
    extensive comparisons with other existing solutions including
    a detailed user study and ablation studies to gauge the
    effect of each of our contributions on multiple datasets</p>

<img class="imgcss" src="/img/Final_diagram.png" alt="Nework architecture">
<span class="captionNetwork text-muted">ZFlow comprises of two modules: A) Garment Warping to deform the garment Ip to align with model Im and generates warped
    garment (Iwrp), and B) Texture Fusion which has two sub-steps - i. Conditional Segmentation to predict a post try-on clothing segmentation
    of the model Mexp ii. Dense Fusion which combines the warped garment (Iwrp) and segmentation mask (Mexp) to generate the final output
    (Itryon). Gated Appearance Flow for garment warping improves textural integrity of Itryon by regularizing the per-pixel flow estimation.
    Dense geometric priors Ipriors improves geometric integrity of the try-on output.</span>
