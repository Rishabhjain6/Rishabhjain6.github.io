<span class="caption text-muted">Human reposing involves changing the orientation of a

<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>The task of human reposing involves generating a realistic
    image of a person standing in an arbitrary conceivable
    pose. There are multiple difficulties in generating perceptually
    accurate images, and existing methods suffer from
    limitations in preserving texture, maintaining pattern coherence,
    respecting cloth boundaries, handling occlusions,
    manipulating skin generation, etc. These difficulties are further
    exacerbated by the fact that the possible space of pose
    orientation for humans is large and variable, the nature
    of clothing items is highly non-rigid, and the diversity in
    body shape differs largely among the population. To alleviate
    these difficulties and synthesize perceptually accurate
    images, we propose VGFlow. Our model uses a visibilityguided
    flow module to disentangle the flow into visible and
    invisible parts of the target for simultaneous texture preservation
    and style manipulation. Furthermore, to tackle distinct
    body shapes and avoid network artifacts, we also incorporate
    a self-supervised patch-wise ”realness” loss to
    improve the output. VGFlow achieves state-of-the-art results
    as observed qualitatively and quantitatively on different
    image quality metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, FID).</p>

<span class="captionNetwork text-muted">VGFlow FlowVis module takes in concatenated I<sub>s</sub>, K<sub>s</sub> & K<sub>t</sub> as input. We predict two flow pyramids at multiple scales for different
    visibility regions using a Unet architecture. Subsequently, these flow pyramids are combined using Gated Aggregation and upsampled
    via Convex upsampling. Losses L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>vgg</sub>, are imposed on the visible areas and L<sub>vgg</sub> , L<sub>sty</sub> are imposed on the invisible areas.</span>
