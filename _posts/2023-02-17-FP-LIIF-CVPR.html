<h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>

<p>Face parsing is defined as the per-pixel labeling of images containing human faces. The labels are defined to
    identify key facial regions like eyes, lips, nose, hair, etc.
    In this work, we make use of the structural consistency
    of the human face to propose a lightweight face-parsing
    method using a Local Implicit Function network, FP-LIIF.
    We propose a simple architecture having a convolutional
    encoder and a pixel MLP decoder that uses 1/26th number of parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models
    and yet matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on
    multiple datasets, like CelebAMask-HQ and LaPa. We do
    not use any pretraining, and compared to other works, our
    network can also generate segmentation at different resolutions without any changes in the input resolution. This
    work enables the use of facial segmentation on low-compute
    or low-bandwidth devices because of its higher FPS and
    smaller model size.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Network architecture</h2>

<img class="imgcss" src="/img/Encoder-liif.png" alt="Nework architecture">
<span class="captionNetwork text-muted">Encoder Architecture: It has three res-block groups. The first two (2,6) res-block groups, followed by a strided conv per group,
    are mainly used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the activation maps. The final group of res-blocks creates the grid of features vectors
    Z. Notice each res-block group has a group-level residual connection.</span>

<img class="imgcss" src="/img/decoder-liif.png" alt="Nework architecture">
<span class="captionNetwork text-muted">Decoder Architecture: Our decoder takes in the feature grid Z from the encoder and performs unfolding and global avg-pooling
    as shown in the figure. A two layer fully connected MLP is used to bring down the number of channels in the unfolded volume. This is
    upsampled and concatenated with global pool feature g and positional encoding. Finally a four layer MLP is applied per spatial location to
    generate the class-wize probability distribution.</span>
